# WebScrapingCompanyDataOffSearchResults
This is based on a job offer I saw on upwork and decided it would be a fun personal project. Click on output.csv to see the results of the data stored in the csv files (phone, fax, email, address, company logging distribution, etc). Otherwise click on the .py file to see the code 
The url for the website that upwork wanted data from is: http://bls.mind-over-data.com/index.cfm/external/SearchResults/Handbook/1/%20/speciesRegionCompanyType/-1/7
